<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my first "big" and independent project since I decided to start programming in Python/Django. "Manage Your Company App" was created to make it easier to manage company (focused on companies in the renewable energy industry). I know from experience that the management of work, installation squads and employees in this industry is difficult. This application will help with this problem.

Here's why:
* The management of the company's resources is usually done by phone and excel, and as a result, there is a lot of confusion and misunderstandings.
* There is a lack of one simple system thanks to which it would be easier to manage company
* One of the elements that cause the planned work to fail is bad weather. This application will help you predict what works should be planned.


Of course, the project is not yet complete. I will add more news in my spare time so that the app actually becomes helpful!


### Built With

These are the main technologies used to create this application.

* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django 3.2.9](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [PostgresSQL](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This application is not yet on any server because it is not done. If you want to try it on this version you can run it on your computer, taking project folders and files.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

If you have downloaded the project and managed to get it working properly, you can see how it all works.

After launching the app, we are on the home page where you can log in or create a new user.

[![login-full.png](https://i.postimg.cc/dVjHqRQT/login-full.png)](https://postimg.cc/4YnbP99J)

Once logged in, we are taken to the application dashboard. Unlogged user has no access here.

As we can see in the screenshot above, we can do several things such as create new employees, squads or investments. 

[![list-squads.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3M3GFC/list-squads.png)](https://postimg.cc/5Y4gWkrV)

We choose to see list of squads.

[![edit-squad.png](https://i.postimg.cc/x8ntmc14/edit-squad.png)](https://postimg.cc/2b9QRjvQ)

We can edit any squad.

[![calendar.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QM7bnpBz/calendar.png)](https://postimg.cc/PLtYCvQb)

We have also calendar (in progress)

[![selected-day.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zD7kMDBq/selected-day.png)](https://postimg.cc/0r6mKsD4)

We can select any day and see what investment is scheduled
