<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![welcome-site.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qqs5qnGF/welcome-site.png)](https://postimg.cc/30wBbkVj)

This is my first "big" and independent project since I decided to start programming in Python/Django. "Manage Your Company App" was created to make it easier to manage company (focused on companies in the renewable energy industry). I know from experience that the management of work, installation squads and employees in this industry is difficult. This application will help with this problem.

Here's why:
* The management of the company's resources is usually done by phone and excel, and as a result, there is a lot of confusion and misunderstandings.
* There is a lack of one simple system thanks to which it would be easier to manage company
* One of the elements that cause the planned work to fail is bad weather. This application will help you predict what works should be planned.


Of course, the project is not yet complete. I will add more news in my spare time so that the app actually becomes helpful!


### Built With

* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
